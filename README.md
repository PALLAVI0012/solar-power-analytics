# 🌞 Solar Data Analytics (Beginner Project)

This is my **first real-world data science project**, where I explore solar power generation data to learn data wrangling, feature engineering, and ML modeling step by step.  
I am keeping this project open-source to document my **learning journey** and improve it over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Dataset:** [Solar Power Generation Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)

**Goal:**
- Clean & align SCADA-like solar data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer features for PR, CUF, soiling, clipping
- Build basic prediction/anomaly detection models

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (ML, later stages)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Current Progress

✅ Dataset loaded & cleaned  
✅ EDA completed with visualizations  
⏳ Feature engineering (in progress)  
⏳ ML modeling (planned)  

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Get familiar with SCADA data quality issues
- Learn solar KPIs: PR, CUF, availability
- Build reproducible workflows for analytics
- Practice explainable ML for energy forecasting

---

## 🙏 Call for Guidance

I welcome suggestions, resources, and feedback — especially about SCADA/PV terms, performance metrics, and real-world solar plant analytics.

## 🌱 Why This Project

I believe hands-on, real-world projects teach more than theory.  
This project helps me practice **data wrangling, visualization, and problem-solving**, preparing me for real industry challenges in renewable energy analytics.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add feature engineering pipeline  
- Build simple ML models (baseline energy, anomaly detection)  
- Package code in reproducible scripts  
- Create a dashboard/report
